/*--------------------------The contrl flow exercices------------------------------------*/

1.  Simple If/Else: 
Write code to check if a number is even or odd. Use an if/else statement to display appropriate messages.
2.  Nested If/Else:
Simulate a simple vending machine. Ask the user for money and choice of drink (A, B, C). Use nested if/else statements to dispense the drink or display an "Insufficient Funds" message.
3.  Ternary Operator (if applicable): 
Explore the ternary operator (condensation of if/else) in your language. Write code examples comparing its usage to regular if/else statements.
4.  While Loop:
Write a program that uses a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
5.  For Loop: 
Write a program that uses a for loop to iterate through a list of names and greet each person.
6.  If/Else with Comparisons: 
Write code to check if a student's grade falls within a specific range (A, B, C, D, F) and display the corresponding letter grade.
7.  Break Statement in Loops:
Write a program that iterates through a list of numbers. Use a break statement within the loop to exit when a specific number is found.
8.  Continue Statement in Loops (if applicable)   Explore the continue statement (skips current iteration) in your language. Write code examples demonstrating its usage within loops. 
9.  Switch/Case Statement: 
Write a program that uses a switch/case statement to handle different user menu options (1 - Add, 2 - Subtract, etc.) and perform the corresponding calculations.
10.  Nested Loops: 
Write a program that uses nested loops to create a multiplication table (e.g., rows represent numbers to multiply, columns represent the multiplier).
11.  Flag Variables :
Write code to simulate a guessing game. Use a flag variable to track whether the user guessed the correct number. The loop continues until the guess is correct, and then displays a congratulatory message.
12.  Infinite Loops (with caution) :
Write a program that demonstrates an infinite loop (usually for intentional, ongoing processes).   Make sure to include a way to break out of the loop  (e.g., using a user input to quit).
13.  Looping with User Input:
Write a program that asks the user for a number and then uses a loop to print that number of stars (*).
14.  Recursion (if applicable):
Explore recursion (a function calling itself) in your language. Write a basic example (e.g., factorial calculation) to understand the concept.   Be cautious of infinite recursion! 
15.  Error Handling with Control Flow: 
Write code that takes user input for age. Use control flow statements (if/else) to check if the age is valid (above 18) and display an error message if not.
16.  FizzBuzz: 
Write a program that iterates from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz," for multiples of 5, print "Buzz," and for multiples of both, print "FizzBuzz."
17.  Prime Number Checker: 
Write a program that takes a number as input and uses a loop to determine if it's a prime number (divisible only by 1 and itself).
18.  Password Validation: 
Write a program that prompts the user for a password. Use control flow to enforce password complexity rules (minimum length, uppercase/lowercase letters, etc.).
19.  Simple Calculator:  
Develop a basic calculator program using control flow statements (if/else) to handle different arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on user input.
20.  Guessing Game with Levels:  
Create a guessing game with multiple difficulty levels. Use nested loops and control flow to adjust the number of guesses allowed based on the chosen level.
